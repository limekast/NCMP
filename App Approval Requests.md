<h1 id="app-approval-requests">App approval requests</h1>
<p>The solution can be set to need approval for any new app installation and registration. This is especially relevant when ‘Roles’ are enabled. The app can have multiple roles - such as Employees, Vendors, Customers etc. Each role may or may not need an approval. For instance the Employees and Vendors role may need an approval and the Customer role may not need an approval.</p>
<p>Any pending approvals of users who have installed and registered themselves on the app will be available on this screen. The app administrator can then either ‘Reject’ or ‘Approve’ the pending approval(s).</p>
<h2 id="pre-approving-app-users">Pre-approving app users</h2>
<p>If you may want to pre-approve app users then invite the users using the ‘App invitees’ feature. A user needs to be invited to a specific role. If the user chooses a different role (from what the he or she was invited to), then the user may or may not be pending for approval, depending on the setting for the ‘Role’ the user chose (the role that the user chose may or may not need an approval and therefore that rule will apply).</p>
<h1 id="troubleshooting--faq">Troubleshooting / FAQ</h1>
<p>App approvals are an optional feature and depending on how the app is configured this section may or may not be relevant</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-the-app-available-on-the-stores-ios-and-android-based-on-who-is-allowed-to-see-the-app">Can I make the app available on the stores (iOS and Android) based on who is allowed to see the app</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this platform has no control on the visibility of the apps in the Apple and Android app stores. All controls relating to app approvals will apply post the user downloading, installing and registering the app on their mobile device</p>
