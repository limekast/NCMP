<h2 id="channels-and-subscribers">Channels and Subscribers</h2>
<p>Channels and Subscribers are two fundamental conceptual building blocks making up this No-Code Mobility platform. Having a clear and good understanding of these will go a long way in app administrators being able to solution the platform to well defined communication and collaboration needs of the business.</p>
<h2 id="channels">Channels</h2>
<p>Think of channels simply as a ‘pipe’ which takes information from a source and delivers it at the destination. The destination is where ‘subscribers’ are waiting to consume the information that is being transported.</p>
<p>Depending on the different types and structure the of information, there are different types of channels. The current channel types supported are -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadcast</strong></li>
<li><strong>Group Chat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chat with author(s)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Directory</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cabinet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For further details on each of the channel types, look under the ‘Channel Types’ section in the documentation repository.</p>
<h2 id="subscribers">Subscribers</h2>
<p>Subscribers are end users (humans or machines) who consume the information that is made available on a channel. Subscribers need to explicitly (could be programmatically though, based on channel property settings) <strong>Subscribe</strong> to a channel to be able to access information available on a channel.</p>
