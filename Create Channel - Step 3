<h1 id="create-channel--step-3-channel-properties">Create Channel : Step 3 (Channel Properties)</h1>
<p>What each of the Channel Properties mean -</p>
<h2 id="password-protected">Password Protected</h2>
<p>If you want to Password Protect subscription to your channel, then you need to set this ON and specify a Password. The subscribers on the Mobile App will be prompted to enter the Password while trying to Subscribe to the channel</p>
<h2 id="approval-required">Approval Required</h2>
<p>Set this ON to make your channel private. The Administrator would then have to either approve every subscription request manually or upload a list of users (uniquely identified by their mobile numbers) - as a list of White Listed users who will then be automatically approved to join the channel when a request is received from a new subscriber</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Verification Required</strong> - Set this ON if you want to mandate that subscribers should have verified their mobile number. This will also enable you to see the list of subscribers to your channel. If this is not ON then you will not be able to know who the subscribers of your channel are. This is also a pre-requisie if you need to set the ‘Approval Required’ property</p>
<h2 id="group-chat">Group Chat</h2>
<p>This channel type helps with a chat based group collaboration. Users who are part of such as channel can post messages in the chat group from their mobile app.</p>
<h2 id="chat-with-authors">Chat with author(s)</h2>
<p>This is a many to one (or more) chat wherein a user can initiate a chat with one or more users who have been given the channel administrator privileges. Chats can only be initiated by a subscriber on the mobile app and the chat message is delivered to the one or more channel administrators.</p>
<h2 id="cabinet">Cabinet</h2>
<p>This channel type is useful to configure a folder structured information repository. Content administration has to be done from the web portal where the channel administrator can create folders, sub-folders and have one or more message/information created. There is no limit on the number of folders, sub-folders or pieces of information that can be configured in a cabinet. These configured content then is made available on the user’s mobile app. Any change is automatically synchronized with the user’s app.</p>
<h2 id="directory">Directory</h2>
<p>Directories are the equivalent of a hosted contact book. Each directory can have anywhere from a few entries to 1000s of entries. Directories are created from the web portal and then it appears on the mobile app of all the users who have access to the same and have in turn subscribed to the directory channel. The directory entries have a formatted page based on the ‘form’ that is tagged to the directory. To create a directory, the first step is to create a ‘form’ and then tag this form while creating the directory.<br>
On the mobile app the user can search, sort the entries based on the form field values, last updated time as well as location (provided the entry has is geo-tagged).</p>
<h2 id="forms">Forms</h2>
<p>Forms are a key component to the solution. Forms can be created using the in-built form designer. Forms can then be mapped to a channel (more than one form can be mapped to the same channel). These forms are then available under that channel in the mobile app. User can open any of these forms, key in inputs and submit. Once submitted, these transactions are available to be viewed under the channel on the web portal. Form transactions can be exported to excel.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>This is a simple content channel where the channel administrator can pre-populate a number of information elements. The same is rendered on the mobile app under this channel and users can access by simply scrolling up and down the various contents. Unlike a broadcast channel, no content is stored locally on the user’s mobile device. Instead, every time a user accesses content, the same is downloaded from the server. Users will need internet connectivity to access contents in ‘Content’ channels.</p>
