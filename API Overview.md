<h1 id="api-overview">API Overview</h1>
<p>The platform supports Open APIs which can be invoked from other external systems. APIs can be used amongst other things to -</p>
<ul>
<li>broadcast, unicast or multicast a message</li>
<li>get the list of subscribers on a channel</li>
<li>get the statistics (sent, read counts) for a particular message sent</li>
<li>get channel properties</li>
<li>get app users</li>
<li>and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>For complete details on each of the APIs and how to use them, see the ‘<strong>API Details</strong>’ section.</p>
<p>For invoking App APIs, the App should have been enabled for API support. Get in touch with the solution provider if it is not. A unique API key, with security credentials are needed for APIs to be used. If your App is already enabled for APIs then the key is available in the API section of this portal.</p>
