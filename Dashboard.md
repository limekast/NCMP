<p>As an app administrator, you will only see channels that you have are allowed to administer. Chances are that the app super-administrator (the original administrator to whom the solution was licensed - as identified by the email address), has given you access rights to only the channels you see here. Get in touch with the super-administrator and request for appropriate access.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-list-view-how-can-i-search-or-filter-by-channel-type-or-channel-category-">In the list view, how can I search or filter by channel type or channel category ?</h2>
<p>Use the sort feature by clicking on the column heading of the appropriate column to sort the channel entries.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-see-more-subscribers-than-invited-">Why do I see more subscribers than invited ?</h2>
<p>Channels can be either <strong>Open</strong> (for any user to join without an invitation) or <strong>Closed</strong> (where users can join strictly by invitation only). If a certain channel is open, you may have nobody invited to the channel however a number of subscribers subscribed to the channel. Which therefore explains why certain channels (which are open) having more subscribers than invitees.</p>
<p><em>Note : You can invite users to an open channel as well, such as when an SMS/Text/Email invite needs to be sent to a certain user requesting the user to join a channel.</em></p>
