<h1 id="role-profiles">Role profiles</h1>
<p>Each defined role can be mapped to a profile form. Mapping a form to a profile is optional though, which means all roles need not have a profile form. Profile forms need to be designed using the in-built form designer.<br>
Profile forms are useful if the app needs to capture more user details than the default name, mobile number and email address. For instance an employee profile form may need have form fields relating to employee id, designation, city, state etc which needs to be captured during app installation and registration.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-have-a-profile-form-where-certain-fields-are-only-administered-by-the-app-administrator-and-certain-fields-are-keyed-in-by-the-user-">Can I have a profile form where certain fields are only administered by the App administrator and certain fields are keyed in by the user ?</h2>
<p>Yes, by carefully designing the form (using the editable on mobile or not capability in the form designer) such use cases can be addressed.</p>
