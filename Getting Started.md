<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Now that you have come on board the <strong>LimeKast</strong> <em>No-Code Mobility Platform</em>, please take a few minutes to go through this overview documentation which will help you get started with using the platform to manage your LimeKast powered mobile app.</p>
<p>For more detailed and elaborate documentation, look into the other sections of this document repository.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-limekast-powered-mobile-app">What exactly is a LimeKast powered mobile app</h2>
<p>Firstly, LimeKast is <strong>not</strong> a mobile app. It is a platform on which mobile apps can be built, configured and deployed. The apps themselves are made available through the iOS and Android App stores.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-primary-purpose-the-platform-helps-achieve">What is the primary purpose the platform helps achieve</h2>
<p>The LimeKast platform is built (and it continues to evolve), keeping an enterprise/business’s communication and collaboration needs in mind. A <strong>mobile app</strong> based communication and collaboration is the central theme to the platform.</p>
<p>Some of the key aspects relating to <em>communication and collaboration</em> <strong>(remember mobile app driven)</strong> amongst an eco-system of users within an enterprise are broadly as below -</p>
<ul>
<li>structured communication (rather than free flowing text based)</li>
<li>security - the ability to provide need based access to information based on the user’s role in the enterprise</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
