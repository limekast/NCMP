<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Now that you have come on board the <strong>LimeKast</strong> <em>No-Code Mobility Platform</em>, please take a few minutes to go through this overview documentation which will help you get started with using the platform to manage your LimeKast powered mobile app.</p>
<p>For more detailed and elaborate documentation, look into the other sections of this document repository.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-limekast-powered-mobile-app">What exactly is a LimeKast powered mobile app</h2>
<p>Firstly, LimeKast is <strong>NOT</strong> a mobile app. It is a platform on which mobile apps can be built, configured, deployed and re-configured. The apps themselves are made available through the iOS and Android App stores.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-primary-purpose-the-platform-helps-achieve">What is the primary purpose the platform helps achieve</h2>
<p>The LimeKast platform is built (and it continues to evolve), keeping an enterprise/business’s communication and collaboration needs in mind. A <strong>mobile app</strong> based communication and collaboration is the central theme to the platform.</p>
<p>Some of the key aspects relating to <strong>communication and collaboration</strong> <em>(remember mobile app driven)</em> amongst an eco-system of users within an enterprise are broadly as below -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured communication</strong>, rather than free flowing text (such as in common IM apps)</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - the ability to provide need based access to information based on the user’s role in the enterprise</li>
<li><strong>Audit trail</strong> - the ability for an enterprise to measure the communication effectiveness amongst its users</li>
<li><strong>Communication logs</strong> - for future reference as also an evolving knowledge base</li>
<li><strong>Retain its branding</strong> - the ability to retain and leverage its branding with their user base</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-no-code-mobililty-app-platform">What is a ‘No-Code Mobililty App’ platform</h2>
<p>On LimeKast, all the apps run off a common server side code logic. The app code itself is also different (from one app to another) only to the extent of the logo and the app name being different. Therefore, app publishers and administrators (of LimeKast powered mobile apps) need not worry about any software coding. Rather, they simply configure the app channels, themes, other administrators from the app management web portal. The ‘software code’ itself is taken care of !</p>
<h2 id="what-next-">What next ?</h2>
<p>With the above basic understanding of the LimeKast platform’s design and intended usage (in an enterprise), you are now ready to go on to the next sections and understand how the configure the app to suit your specific business needs.</p>
