<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Now that you have come on board this <em><strong>No-Code Mobility Platform</strong></em>, please take a few minutes to go through this overview documentation which will help you get started with using the platform to manage your mobile app.</p>
<p>For more detailed and elaborate documentation, look into the relevant sections of this document repository. There are contextual help available on each page, which will give an overview of the section as also suggested usages.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-this-platform-about-">What exactly is this platform about ?</h2>
<p>It is a platform on which mobile apps can be built, configured, deployed and re-configured. The apps themselves are made available through the iOS and Android App stores.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-primary-purpose-this-platform-helps-achieve">What is the primary purpose this platform helps achieve</h2>
<p>The platform is built (and it continues to evolve), keeping an enterprise/business’s communication and collaboration needs in mind. A <strong>mobile app</strong> based communication and collaboration is the central theme to the platform.</p>
<p>Some of the key aspects relating to <strong>communication and collaboration</strong> <em>(remember mobile app driven)</em> amongst an eco-system of users within an enterprise are broadly as below -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured communication</strong>, rather than free flowing text (such as in common IM apps)</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - the ability to provide need based access to information based on the user’s role in the enterprise</li>
<li><strong>Audit trail</strong> - the ability for an enterprise to measure the communication effectiveness amongst its users</li>
<li><strong>Communication logs</strong> - for future reference as also an evolving knowledge base</li>
<li><strong>Retain its branding</strong> - the ability to retain and leverage its branding with their user base</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-no-code-mobililty-app-platform">What is a ‘No-Code Mobililty App’ platform</h2>
<p>On the platform, all the apps run off a common server side code logic. The app code itself is also different (from one app to another) only to the extent of the logo and the app name. Therefore, app publishers and administrators need not worry about any software coding. Rather, they simply configure the app channels, themes, other administrators from the app management web portal. The ‘software code’ itself is taken care of !</p>
<h1 id="what-next-">What next ?</h1>
<p>With the above basic understanding of the platform’s design and intended usage (in an enterprise), you are now ready to go on to the next sections and understand how to configure the app to suit your specific business needs relating to communication and collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="channels-and-subscribers">Channels and Subscribers</h2>
<p>Channels and Subscribers are two fundamental conceptual building blocks making up the <em>No-Code Mobility platform</em>. Having a clear and good understanding of these will go a long way in app administrators being able to solution the platform to well defined communication and collaboration needs of the business.</p>
<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>
<p>Think of channels simply as a ‘<strong>pipe</strong>’ which takes information from a source and delivers it at the destination. The destination is where ‘subscribers’ are waiting to consume the information that is being transported.</p>
<p>Depending on the different types and structure the of information, there are different types of channels. The current channel types supported are -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadcast</strong></li>
<li><strong>Group chat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chat with author(s)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Directory</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cabinet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong></li>
<li><strong>Content</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For further details on each of the channel types, look under the ‘Channel Types’ section in the documentation repository.</p>
<h3 id="subscribers">Subscribers</h3>
<p>Subscribers are end users (humans or machines) who consume the information that is made available on a channel. Subscribers need to explicitly (could be programmatically though, based on channel property settings) <strong>Subscribe</strong> to a channel to be able to access information available on a channel.</p>
<h1 id="app-administration">App Administration</h1>
<p>The platform supports distributed administration across a number of different app and channel administrators, thereby reducing the app administration and upkeep overhead on one single person.</p>
<p>The app administration can be done by one or more administrators. On account creation, there is <strong>ONE</strong> app administrator who has rights to administer all aspects of the app. This administrator can in turn create other app administrators and specify privileges (under App -&gt; User Management -&gt; App Administrators)</p>
<h1 id="channel-administration">Channel Administration</h1>
<p>The app administrator can further assign channel level administrators. Each channel can have one or more channel administrators.</p>
<p>Each of the channel administrators can further be assigned privileges to administer different aspects of the channel. For instance, a certain channel administrator may be allowed to manage the subscriber in the channel but not allowed to administer contents in the channel.</p>
<h1 id="forms">Forms</h1>
<p>Forms are a central part to the solution and it is a key component which allows for structuring data that is managed in the platform.</p>
<p>The usage of forms can be broadly categorized across 2 areas</p>
<ul>
<li>To present data in a formatted manner (Output)</li>
<li>To collet data from end users on mobile devices in a structured and formatted manner (Input)</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure to the content (either Input or Output) is designed by using the ‘Form Designer’ which is made available in this portal as part of the solution. The ‘Form Designer’ however is access controlled and the app administrator can make this available to other app administrators on a need basis.</p>
<p>For details on how to use the ‘Form Designer’, look up the Help section under ‘Form Designer’</p>
<h1 id="open-apis">Open APIs</h1>
<p>The platform supports a number of Open APIs which helps integrate other IT systems into this communication/collaboration platform. APIs are what can enable other systems to fire messages to users in the App, retrieve metrics relating to users, subscribers to a channel, get channel properties etc.</p>
<p>For details on how to use the APIs, look up the Help section under APIs.</p>
<h1 id="mobile-apps">Mobile Apps</h1>
<p>Finally, all of the administration that happens here on the web portal is to make the iOS and Android Mobile Apps behave and function a certain way.</p>
<p>Across the Help sections here, reference will be made to the mobile apps as and when relevant.</p>
