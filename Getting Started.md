<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Now that you have come on board this <em><strong>No-Code Mobility Platform</strong></em>, please take a few minutes to go through this overview documentation which will help you get started with using the platform to manage your mobile app.</p>
<p>For more detailed and elaborate documentation, look into the other sections of this document repository.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-this-platform-about-">What exactly is this platform about ?</h2>
<p>It is a platform on which mobile apps can be built, configured, deployed and re-configured. The apps themselves are made available through the iOS and Android App stores.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-primary-purpose-this-platform-helps-achieve">What is the primary purpose this platform helps achieve</h2>
<p>The platform is built (and it continues to evolve), keeping an enterprise/business’s communication and collaboration needs in mind. A <strong>mobile app</strong> based communication and collaboration is the central theme to the platform.</p>
<p>Some of the key aspects relating to <strong>communication and collaboration</strong> <em>(remember mobile app driven)</em> amongst an eco-system of users within an enterprise are broadly as below -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured communication</strong>, rather than free flowing text (such as in common IM apps)</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - the ability to provide need based access to information based on the user’s role in the enterprise</li>
<li><strong>Audit trail</strong> - the ability for an enterprise to measure the communication effectiveness amongst its users</li>
<li><strong>Communication logs</strong> - for future reference as also an evolving knowledge base</li>
<li><strong>Retain its branding</strong> - the ability to retain and leverage its branding with their user base</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-no-code-mobililty-app-platform">What is a ‘No-Code Mobililty App’ platform</h2>
<p>On the platform, all the apps run off a common server side code logic. The app code itself is also different (from one app to another) only to the extent of the logo and the app name being different. Therefore, app publishers and administrators need not worry about any software coding. Rather, they simply configure the app channels, themes, other administrators from the app management web portal. The ‘software code’ itself is taken care of !</p>
<h1 id="what-next-">What next ?</h1>
<p>With the above basic understanding of the platform’s design and intended usage (in an enterprise), you are now ready to go on to the next sections and understand how to configure the app to suit your specific business needs relating to <em>communication and collaboration</em>.</p>
<h2 id="channels-and-subscribers">Channels and Subscribers</h2>
<p>Channels and Subscribers are two fundamental conceptual building blocks making up th No-Code Mobility platform. Having a clear and good understanding of these will go a long way in app administrators being able to solution the platform to well defined communication and collaboration needs of the business.</p>
<h2 id="channels">Channels</h2>
<p>Think of channels simply as a ‘pipe’ which takes information from a source and delivers it at the destination. The destination is where ‘subscribers’ are waiting to consume the information that is being transported.</p>
<p>Depending on the different types and structure the of information, there are different types of channels. The current channel types supported are -</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadcast</strong></li>
<li><strong>Group chat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chat with author(s)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Directory</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cabinet</strong></li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For further details on each of the channel types, look under the ‘Channel Types’ section in the documentation repository.</p>
<h2 id="subscribers">Subscribers</h2>
<p>Subscribers are end users (humans or machines) who consume the information that is made available on a channel. Subscribers need to explicitly (could be programmatically though, based on channel property settings) <strong>Subscribe</strong> to a channel to be able to access information available on a channel.</p>
