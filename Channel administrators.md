# Channel administrators

The creator of the channel (having the role of  an administrator) can further assign other users who are allowed to administer/author content on the channel. 

While assigning a new administrator, by default the user has authoring rights, checking the additional checkbox to the right assigns this new user the additional administrative rights as well. Admins can be given access to approve subscription requests, change channel properties, approve content from authors etc. The new admin of the channel can be assigned all administrative rights or limit the rights to delete an existing channel or as decided based on the role he plays in the organization
