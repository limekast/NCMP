<h1 id="user-role-categories">User role categories</h1>
<p>For Apps that uses roles, the roles can further be categorized under role categories. This is optional and even if the apps use roles, role categories are not a must. If there are large number of roles defined, then it is a good idea to categorize the roles under role categories. These categories then show up on the mobile app of the user so as to present the roles in a more user friendly manner.<br>
A sort order to decide the order in which the categories should show on the mobile app can be set as well. By default all categories have an equal sort order set to the value ‘0’. Sort order is applied in an ascending order with the categories with a lower sort order presented first on the mobile app.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-delete-or-modify-an-existing-category-name-">Can I delete or modify an existing category name ?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can edit the category name or change the sort order any time. A category can be deleted only if there are no roles mapped to that particular category.</p>
