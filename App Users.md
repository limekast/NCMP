<h1 id="app-users">App users</h1>
<p>This is a report on all of the App invitees as well as the current or previously installed App users. There are 2 columns relating to users who have been invited as well as users who have installed the app. Apart from the user name, mobile number and email address (if available), the other information available are the date the user registered, last ween time, view detailed profile (if available) and the action buttons for synchronizing the channel gallery of the user’s mobile app and the remote wipe.</p>
<h1 id="troubleshooting--faq">Troubleshooting / FAQ</h1>
<h2 id="why-is-it-that-some-of-the-users-do-not-have-a-detailed-profile-view-">Why is it that some of the users do not have a detailed profile view ?</h2>
<p>Every user role may not have a profile form attached to it. For users who come in with a role that does not have a profile form, there is no detailed profile to show.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-synchronize-channel-gallery-action-button-do-">What does the ‘Synchronize channel gallery’ action button do ?</h2>
<p>In the event of the user’s mobile app channel gallery being out of synch with the expected list (though this is only a remote possibility), the app administrator can click on this button to refresh and synchronize the channel gallery of the user’s mobile app with a consistent and expected list. This can be useful to overcome certain scenarios where in the user is not seeing an expected channel or seeing an uninvited/non-existent channel.<br>
<em>Please note that by design the user’s app should see channels as expected and therefore this feature need not be exercised. Exercising this option is however harmless as well !</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-remote-wipe-action-for-">What is the ‘Remote wipe’ action for ?</h2>
<p>If a certain user is not expected to have any further access to contents in the app (such as when an employee leaves an organization), the app administrator can ‘remote wipe’ the data from the user’s mobile app. All data locally stored on the user’s device will be deleted and the user will not have further access to any of the app features.</p>
<h2 id="can-a-previously-remote-wiped-user-re-install-the-app-">Can a previously ‘remote wiped’ user re-install the app ?</h2>
<p>Yes, the user can delete and reinstall the app. The system will treat this installation as a fresh install and the same default access controls will apply.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-remote-wipe-uninstall-the-app-from-the-users-mobile-device-">Does the ‘Remote wipe’ uninstall the app from the user’s mobile device ?</h2>
<p>No, as the the solution has no control on App installs or App un-installations.</p>
<h2 id="can-an-uninstallation-of-the-app-by-a-user-be-detected-">Can an uninstallation of the app by a user be detected ?</h2>
<p>There is no way currently to detect a user un-installing the app. Therefore, the column with the status which says user installed the app is used to only indicate that the user did install the app. If the user uninstalls the app, the installed status does not change.</p>
