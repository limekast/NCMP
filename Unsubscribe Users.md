<p>The app can house a number of subscribers across a number of different channels. This reports shows the list of App users from where you can select a particular app user and then view the channels that the user has subscribed to. Note that it does <strong>NOT</strong> list the channels the user is ‘Not Subscribed’ to.<br>
Use this list to unsubscribe users from certain channels by marking the checkboxes OFF and saving them. Action is restricted to one user at a time.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-it-that-you-cannot-subscribe-a-user-the-same-way-as-unsubscribing-a-user-">Why is it that you cannot ‘Subscribe’ a user the same way as ‘Unsubscribing’ a user ?</h2>
<p>User subscription is an action that is initiated from the user’s mobile app. Unsubscribing a users however can be forcefully initiated by the app administrator and actioned on the mobile app of the user.<br>
<em>There is an option of ‘auto-subscribing’ a user however, by setting it as a channel property which applies across all users of the mobile app.</em></p>
