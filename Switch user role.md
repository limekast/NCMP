<h1 id="switch-user-role">Switch user role</h1>
<p>User roles can be switched by the administrator at any time. This can be used in scenarios where say a user’s role needs to be switched from say a certain department such as ‘Finance executive’ to ‘HR executive’.</p>
<p>Whenever a user’s role is switched, a request is fired to the user’s mobile app. The next time the user opens the app, he or she will be prompted to switch role (user does not have a choice to reject this request though). Once the user accepts then the app will go through a soft restart and come back with the newly requested role.</p>

<p>Yes, users can on their own switch role as well. However, all the rules relating to getting access with the new role will apply.</p>
