# Channel role mapping

**Roles** can be created when there is a need to control channel level access to different types of users
For eg. an organization can have employees, dealers, vendors and other users. Each set of user can be assigned a role name and while creating a channel appropriate roles can be assigned to the channel. 
A channel mapped to the role employee will be available to users who choose the role employee while installing the app.

## Will the role mapping capability be available by default ?
- By default the app will not have any role
