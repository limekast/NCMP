What each of the channel properties mean

Setting this option ON will prompt the users on the mobile application side to disclose their geographical location (as identified by the GPS on the mobile device). 

**Once on subscription** - user's location is captured only once and is not being tracked in real time as and when the customer moves

**Regular intervals** - users will have to enable the GPS tracking on their phones and their location will be tracked at regular intervals

This will help you identify your channel subscribers with additional information apart from their mobile number

## Allow subscribers to broadcast

If you want to allow subscribers to send broadcasts as well, then set this ON which will then enable the option on every subscribers mobile app for them to be able to send out broadcasts as well.

Subscribers can then get the previous broadcasts by tapping on the 'Load Previous' button. Setting this ON will restrict users from being able to get previous broadcast messages


## Generate unique message id
