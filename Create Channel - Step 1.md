<h2 id="create-channel--step-1">Create Channel : Step 1</h2>
<p>This is the first step in the 4 step wizard to create a new channel. Channels created here will in turn appear (based on the channel visibility properties set in the further steps) on the mobile app of the users who have installed the app.</p>
<h3 id="channel-name">Channel Name</h3>
<p>Give the channel an appropriate name based on the type and nature of information made available in the channel. Special characters are not allowed and the name can be a maximum of 40 characters. Channel names need to be unique and therefore duplicate channel names are not allowed.</p>
<h3 id="channel-logo">Channel Logo</h3>
<p>Every channel should have a logo. Ensure that the logo is in-line with the channel’s name and it is a good practice to keep channel logos simple, consistent in its design (color, image size etc) with the other channel’s logos. Having well designed channel logos will help give the mobile app provide an aesthetically pleasant and professional user experience for end users of the mobile app.<br>
Pick either a custom logo (such as an image from your desktop) or from one of the many logos provided in the library. The single colored icons can be customized further using the in-built color picker.</p>
<h3 id="channel--category">Channel  Category</h3>
<p>Select an appropriate channel category from the previously configured channel categories. If there are no custom channel categories defined then select the default.</p>
<h3 id="select-roles">Select Roles</h3>
<p>Select the different user roles (one or more, minimum one) in which the channel should be made available. Users who belong to a particular role will only see channels that are mapped to that particular role.</p>
<h3 id="channel-description">Channel Description</h3>
<p>Give the channel a brief description so that users get a preview on what the channel is about. This channel description is presented to users on the mobile app on the ‘Subscription’ page, helping users decide if they would want to subscribe to the channel.</p>
