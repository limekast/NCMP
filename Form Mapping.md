# Form Mapping
Allows to map a form to a channel

Directory and Form channel creation requires form mapping in the step 2 of channel creation.
You will require forms for a survey, for including additional forms in the form channel or for using form as a template within a broadcast channel. Forms created under form designer can be mapped to the channel where it is required

To map a form to a channel under form mapping, click on the pen icon available against each channel. The popup that appears lists all the forms created under form management. Choose the forms that you need to map to a channel and save. 

## Where will the mapped forms be available  for different channel types 

**Broadcast channel**- mapped forms will be available under survey and while composing message within broadcast description where you have the option to choose text or the form template (when the content needs to sent in a desired format)
**Directory channel** - can have only one form mapped during channel creation
**Form channel** - all mapped forms will list on opening the channel in users phone
**Cabinet channel** -  while composing message within broadcast description where you have the option to choose text or the form template (when the content needs to sent in a desired format)
