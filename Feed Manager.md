# Feed Manager
Allows a channels content to be shareable with other channels. 

While creating channel and setting channel properties in step 3 enable the option feed management to allow feed of content from this channel to any other channel, this channel will then list under the request new feed search of other channels


## Will the content from the channel enabled for feed broadcast to all other channels?
one channel can request for broadcast content from another channel. The request will then be pending on the administrator(s) of the channel from which feed is being requested. If the administrator of the requested channel approves the feed request then any broadcast made on the requested channel will automatically be broadcast on the channel that is being fed as well. Further, there is an additional option that can be SET to Approve channel feeds for each of the broadcasts.

## Does feed manage allow feed of content from one app to the other ?
