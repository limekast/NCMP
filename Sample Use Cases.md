<h1 id="sample-use-cases">Sample Use Cases</h1>
<p>Finally, ket us look at the Use Cases where this solution is relevant and can be applied. Theis platform and solution is <strong>agnostic</strong> to the <strong>geography and industry vertical</strong> where this solution can be applied. Just like email and text messages apply pretty much to any business, the solution has universal relevance. Communication and collaboration amongst its eco-system of users is central to every business. Since this platform fundamentally addresses the communication and collaboration problem, it therefore applies universally.</p>
<p>How this solution differs from other app based communication solutions is in the fact this solution provides a more definite and defined structure (using Channels, Subscribers and Forms) to the communication.</p>
<p>Email is more about free flowing unstructured communication whereas this is more about structured communication. Email is <strong>NOT</strong> permission based, whereas communication on this platform is strictly <strong>OPT-IN</strong> based, thereby making the communication spam-free and need based. App based communication has inherent controls built-in to track message statuses (sent, read acknowledged etc) as compared to no such controls existing in the email world. Mobile app based communication also supports rich media (image, videos etc) better than traditional email messages.</p>
<p>Some of the use cases where the solution can be used are as below -</p>
