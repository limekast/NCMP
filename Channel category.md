# Channel category
Helps classify channels together

All created categories are listed here. To add a new category provide a name and give a sort order number. 
The category with the least sort order number appears first and the category with the largest sort order number appears in the end.

For e.g. an educational institution can have categories like Students, Faculty, Admin, Stakeholders. Channels of a type/category can be grouped together.
