<h1 id="audit-trail--mobile">Audit trail : Mobile</h1>
<p>This is an optional feature which can be enabled for mobile app side audit trail logs. It is important that the App publisher as part of the Terms Of Service lets users know about their actions being captured.</p>
<p>Every user action on the mobile app, such as opening a certain section of the app screen is logged on a periodic basis. Each entry in the mobile audit trail has details on <strong>which user</strong> (identified by their name and mobile number), took <strong>what action</strong> (the action details) at <strong>what time</strong> captured and presented.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-it-that-the-latest-trail-logs-dont-appear-immediately-">Why is it that the latest trail logs don’t appear immediately ?</h2>
<p>Mobile audit trails are cached on the user’s mobile device and on a periodic basis (based on time intervals as well as number of logs) uploaded to the server. Therefore, expect a delay between the actual user action on the mobile app and the logs appearing here on the portal. The time interval is not expected to be greater than 24 hours.</p>
