# Content Approval

Channel Administrators are allowed to assign one or more users as co-authors to a channel. These co-authors are then allowed to author and send broadcasts as well. There is an additional setting under this which can be set to allow them to send their broadcasts with or without the approval of the channel administrator. Setting the option with approval enables administrators to approve content authored by co-authors before they are broadcast to the channel subscribers. 

**Pending approval** - will list all the broadcast which has come to the admin for approval

**Rejected content** - admin has the option to accept or reject a broadcast pending on them for approval. All rejected broadcasts will list here

## Can a broadcast which require admin approval be scheduled ?
