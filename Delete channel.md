# Delete channel
If you do not want a channel to appear anymore on the app and on the portal then you can delete the channel here.

All the channels on the app are listed here. On selecting the delete icon a popup with message appears asking **Do you want to delete  xyz channel ?**  
Deletion of this channel will result in all subscribers of this channel being automatically Unsubscribed.
If you wish to **Delete channel and all contents from user devices as well** then enable the check box.
Administrator will have to **Enter password to proceed**

## Is it possible to role back a deleted channel?
A channel once deleted cannot be retrieved. All content in the channel is lost. 

If you wish to create another channel with the same subscribers, export the list of subscribers before deleting the channel.
