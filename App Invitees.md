<h1 id="app-invitees">App invitees</h1>
<p>An App administrator can invite users to the app by adding them individually by clicking on the ‘Add’ button and keying in the details of the invited user, such as Name, Mobile number, Email address and Role (optional, if the app supports roles). On inviting a user, an SMS/Text/Email message will get triggered inviting the user to download and install the app from the store.</p>
<p>Ensure that users are invited to the right role (such as inviting employees to the ‘Employee’ role, assuming that the ‘Employee’ role has been created as part of ‘Role management’.</p>
<p>The status on whether the invited user has installed the App or not is indicated in the ‘Installed’ column in the report.</p>

<p>Chances are that an SMS/Text Gateway has not been configured for the App. Please get in touch with the solution provider and check if the gateway has been configured correctly. Note that this message gets triggered only your own gateway has been provisioned.</p>

<p>Yes, users can choose a role that is different from the invited role. However, the role invited to by the app administrator will be presented to the user by default which the user can then opt to change. If the new role doesn’t need an approval then the user will be allowed to proceed and will get completely on-boarded. If the new role that the user needs approval then it will be pending for approval as an ‘app approval request’ on the app administrator.</p>
