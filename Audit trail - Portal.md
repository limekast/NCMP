<h1 id="audit-trail--portal">Audit trail : Portal</h1>
<p>This page logs all App and Channel administrator actions on the portal for purposes of audit. Logs are maintained for the previous 180 days by default, which can be extended based on specific user requests.</p>
<p>Each entry in the audit trail has information relating to <strong>which user</strong> (app/channel administrator) took <strong>what action</strong> at <strong>what time</strong>. The action detail is captured at 2 levels, the high level menu item selected and then the exact action type. By default, the last 50 actions are displayed. To see a larger window of actions, select the ‘From’ and ‘To’ dates in the calendar control appropriately. Additionally, there is an Excel export feature to export all logs into an Excel sheet.</p>
