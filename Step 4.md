## Step 4
The final step for channel creation

Configuration of Welcome Message and number of previous messages to be sent

In the final step for channel creation, configure/edit if required the default Welcome Message which consists of the title, logo and description that is sent to a new subscriber. Additionally, set the number of historical messages (previous messages broadcast on the channel) that the new subscriber will receive on subscribing to a channel. 

Once you configure these, click on the 'Finish' for your channel to be created.
